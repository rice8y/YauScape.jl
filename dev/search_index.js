Higher values of n result in more intricate surfaces.\nα::Float64:  Specifies the rotation angle (in radians) of the 3D plot around the z-axis. This parameter allows you to view the Calabi-Yau manifold from different perspectives.\ngrid_res::Int64:  Controls the resolution of the grid used to generate the surface. A higher grid_res value leads to a smoother and more detailed surface, but increases computation time.\ncolor_palette::Symbol:  Sets the color palette used for coloring the surface patches.  It accepts any valid Plots.jl color palette symbol (e.g., :rainbow, :viridis, :blues).\ncolor::Symbol or nothing:  If provided with a color symbol, it overrides the color_palette and applies a uniform color to all surface patches. If set to nothing, the color_palette is used for coloring.","category":"page"},{"location":"#2.-Time-Evolution-Animation:","page":"Home","title":"2.
